      <h2>Day 1:The Running Sum of Array 1D</h2>
      <p>Used a for loop and the length property to create a new array that stored the running sum of the numbers as the for loop executed. Thank you javaScript for having such luxuries as .length, and just knowing what data type I want you to use. SOOOO glad I didnt have to untangle something like this:</p>
      <p>int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; int size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(int);</p>

      <h2>Day 2: Richest Customer Wealth</h2>
      <p>You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
        A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.</p>
      <p>I need to find the total of [i] and [j] then compare the two totals to determind which customer has the highest number aka most wealth.</p>
